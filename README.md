## Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide a report for an investment bank considering creating a new bitcoin investment portfolio. The paper describes the cryptocurrencies that may be purchased as well as how they can be categorized in order to create a classification scheme for this new investment. To complete this research, I'm running unsupervised machine learning algorithms on the data from Crypto Compare.

## Results

I started by cleaning up the data to only include cryptocurrencies that were being traded, utilizing a specific methodology and a full set of data. I now possess 532 different cryptocurrencies as a result. Then, to show how the various cryptocurrencies are organized, I created a three-dimensional graph. Each point is identified by name and the algorithm that created it.

Then I made a two-dimensional graph to demonstrate the link between total coin supply and total coins mined, so you could see how one currency stacks up against the others. The name of the currency is included in each point.

## Summary

The three-dimensional graph shows four separate groups. The majority of currencies can be divided into two groups that are closely related to one another. While the second group only has one currency, the first group has several unique currencies that are isolated from the others. This shows that most currencies perform consistently, while a few are exceptions. To determine if these outliers are overachievers or underachievers, I'd need to conduct more research. One way I can draw a connection is by taking a look at the graph of total currency supply vs total coins mined.
Between 0% and 40% of the largest currency by volume, the majority of the data points for the two major groups are dispersed. The group with several currencies is very close to having 0% of the largest currency, but the group with just one currency has 100% of the greatest currency. In order to better comprehend these cryptocurrencies' performance, I would like to conduct additional research on them by looking at their historical price. This would enable investors to assess the risk or dependability of their investment based on the many cryptocurrencies they invest in.
